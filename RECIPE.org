Recipe to extract Sombrero from HiRep

* clone HiRep
* build the 6 libraries with the perl/c++ code generator
Done automatically with Make from HiRep's makefile
* clone Sombrero without LibHR
* copy some stuff from sombrero into Hirep
- sombrero/sombrero directory
- Include/suN.h
- Include/suN_repr_func.h
- Include/suN_types.h
* clone pycparser
* make callgraph with sombrero and LibHR, find the useful sources
* copy the useful sources in the sombrero repository
filtering out the unused functions
* copy the makefiles in the sombrero repository
not overwriting the ones that are already there 
* copy the useful headers in the sombrero repository
* copy other manually listed files that for some reason were not detected
(try to reduce this to a minumum)
* Add the libhr stubs needed by the performance estimations
* removed unused functions from header files (Ã  la grep -v) (optional)
* package everything and publish it somewhere accessible
