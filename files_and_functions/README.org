* Set up
** ~pycparser~
~pycparser~ is needed.
We need also the fake libc provided by it.
we need to clone the repository from github for that,
as neither installing via ~pip~
or downloading the tarball
and using ~python setup.py install~
would provide the fake libc.
  
* NOTES
~pycparser~ is slow.
We the parsing time
and the correctness of the parsing,
we pass a filter function
to the algorithm that builds the call graph,
so that only relevant files are parsed.
