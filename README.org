#+TITLE: Shoplifter

Steals a Sombrero from HiRep's shop.

* Steps

1. clone HiRep
2. build the 6 libraries with the perl/c++ code generator one automatically with Make from HiRep's makefile
3. clone Sombrero without most of LibHR
4. copy some stuff from sombrero into Hirep
   - sombrero/sombrero directory
   - Include/suN.h
   - Include/sombrero.h
   - Include/suN_repr_func.h
   - Include/libhr_defines_interface.h
   - Include/suN_types.h
5. clone pycparser
6. analyse callgraph with sombrero and LibHR, find the useful sources
7. copy and clean the useful sources to the sombrero repository filtering out the unused functions
8. copy the makefiles to the sombrero repository not overwriting the ones that are already there 
9. copy and clean the useful headers to the sombrero repository
10. copy other manually listed files that for some reason were not detected (try to reduce this to a minumum)
11. clean the macros in sombrero, in place

* Additionally

12. compile and run the benchmarks for test
13. package everything and publish it somewhere accessible
